title: "I don't relate to imposter syndrome: A different take on self-comparison and achieving your goals"

The term "Imposter Syndrome" is commonly mentioned in high profile workplaces or graduate schools, e.g., workplaces considered to have high bars for entry.  

For me, it has never struck a chord. 

I view the concept as revolving around feelings of inadequacy, as if one is a fraud awaiting exposure. 

However, I've always framed these feelings differently. To me, it's less about questioning my individual abilities and more about measuring myself against a collective standard set by others, in an often unhealthy and not helpful manner.

**NOTE: this sentence does not fit here!!!**
I frequently find myself in environments that, with enough dedication and hard work, I believe should be accessible to me. 

And let's be honest—most people are "faking it till they make it." This universal uncertainty is not just okay; it's a sign of a shared human experience that we should embrace.

However, the key to navigating this complicated emotional terrain is establishing goals based on personal desires and aspirations—not societal expectations or external judgments. Your motivations for achieving something should come from within, uncompromised by the opinions of others.

But even with a clear personal vision one obstacle remains: your immediate *self-perception*. 

the constant struggle with self-comparison. While this comparison doesn't make me feel out of place in specific environments, it does lead to negative emotions that are, more often than not, beyond my control. This highlights an essential challenge we all face: balancing our long-term vision with our immediate self-perception.

It's also critical to accept an often-overlooked reality: the world has its fair share of difficult people—let's call them "assholes" for the sake of brevity. Understanding this can free us from unrealistic expectations and unnecessary self-judgment.

#### Take action and stop comparing yourself to others
*What are some potential antidotes?* 
- **Identify personal goals.** Consider setting a medium-term goal or crafting a vision for your day-to-day life. This will provide a benchmark to measure your progress, one that's both realistic and personally significant. Not only this, but I think that it will be likwely that you find that the goals or dream life that you write down will not comment on having direct comparisons between yourself and others. 
- **Adopt an abundance mindset**: Change the criteria that you use 
- Acknowledge that people project their insecurities around their own self-perception more than you would initially like to believe. It is important for your own sake to mentally call this out, so that you don't allow their comments to influence your self-perception.
- **Please give me one more point**
- **Limit social media**
