### Questions from the **8) The Formula** chapter that I want to think about: 

#### Can I do nothing with my life? If I did, where would this lead?


#### How can I use an **anti-vision** to clarify what I want out of life? 
In my least ideal life, I would find myself constantly comparing myself to others in an unhealthy manner. This comparison would consume my thoughts and sap my energy, making me neglect my unique skills and potentials. The time I would spend on such comparisons would prevent me from working on projects that truly matter to me.

I feel deeply unfulfilled when I am in a state of constant struggle and limited growth. Stagnation would set in as I find myself surrounded by uninspiring people who neither challenge nor uplift me. This environment would make me complacent, leaving me stuck in a cycle of mediocrity.

One of my greatest fears is becoming someone who lives week-in, week-out solely for the paycheck. The thought of my life boiling down to a perpetual cycle of earning and spending, without meaningful engagement or fulfillment, terrifies me. The pursuit of passion and purpose would be overshadowed by the need to make ends meet.

I dread the possibility of being involved in relationships primarily out of the fear of loneliness. These relationships would be superficial, lacking emotional depth and true connection. My choices would be guided by a sense of obligation or desperation, rather than mutual love and respect.

Financially and professionally, a nightmare scenario for me would be to become addicted to the paycheck, making choices solely based on financial gain. I would be trapped in a career that does not align with my values or interests, and my life would become a monotonous sequence of uninspiring tasks, driven by the need to maintain a certain lifestyle rather than the desire to make meaningful contributions.

#### Why is having a vision, strategy, and creativity the key to becoming a highly paid individual?

#### How do I leverage human behavioural patterns to take back control of my life? 

#### What problems do I solve first? Superficial or metaphysical? 

#### Is selfishness a bad thing? Should I even try to be selfless? 

#### What things do I do a daily basis to actualize my ideal future?

#### Why do most people stay the same their entire life? Why do they get trapped in a loop of negativity? 

#### What is "tactical stress" and how do I use it to make a leap in progress?

#### Why is curiosity the driving force in my personal sucess?

#### How is everything an *iceberg of oppurtunity* to be explored, appreciated, monetized, or mastered?
