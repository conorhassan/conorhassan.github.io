            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://research.qut.edu.au/qutcds/">QUT Centre for Data Science</a>
                in Brisbane, Australia, working with Distinguished Professor <a href="https://research.qut.edu.au/qutcds/staff/kerrie-mengersen/">Kerrie Mengersen</a>
                on methods for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03314">Bayesian federated learning</a> and
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15424">differentially private generative models</a>.
                My thesis is currently under internal review.
            </p>
            <p>
                From May to November 2024, I relocated to Melbourne to complete an internship with the
                machine learning research team at Amazon.
            </p>
            <p>
                My research interests include variational inference, generative models, federated and distributed
                algorithms, latent-variable models, and Bayesian deep learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Previously, I worked as a research data scientist at <a href="https://www.wearoptimo.com/">WearOptimo</a>,
                a biotechnology startup developing microwearable devices, and completed internships in
                <a href="https://www.imc.com/">quantitative trading</a>, <a href="https://ey.com">consulting</a>,
                and at a <a href="https://www.agresearch.co.nz/">national scientific institute</a>.
                I have also worked as a research assistant and tutored seven courses in mathematics and statistics.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am well-versed in using automatic differentiation libraries like JAX and PyTorch,
                as well as probabilistic programming libraries such as NumPyro, PyMC, Pyro, and Stan.
            </p>
