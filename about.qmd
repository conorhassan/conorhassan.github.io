I am a PhD student at the [QUT Centre for Data Science](https://research.qut.edu.au/qutcds/) (in Brisbane, Australia) working with Distinguished Professor [Kerrie Mengersen](https://research.qut.edu.au/qutcds/staff/kerrie-mengersen/) on methods for [*Bayesian federated learning*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03314) and [*differentially private generative models*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15424). My thesis is currently under internal review. 

From May to November 2024, I am relocating to Melbourne to complete an internship with the machine learning research team at Amazon.

My research interests include variational inference, generative models, federated and distributed algorithms, latent-variable models, and Bayesian deep learning.

In the past, I have worked as a research data scientist at [WearOptimo](https://www.wearoptimo.com/), a biotechnology startup developing microwearable devices, and completed internships in [quantitative trading](https://www.imc.com/), [consulting](https://ey.com) and at a [national scientific institute](https://www.agresearch.co.nz/). I have also worked as a research assistant and tutored seven courses in mathematics and statistics, from beginner to Master's level. I am well-versed in using automatic differentiation libraries like *JAX* and *PyTorch*, as well as probabilistic programming libraries such as *NumPyro*, *PyMC*, *Pyro*, and *Stan*.
