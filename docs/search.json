My thesis is currently under internal review.\nFrom May to November 2024, I am relocating to Melbourne to complete an internship with the machine learning research team at Amazon. In December, I am moving to Finland to begin a postdoctoral position with Professor Sami Kaski and others at Aalto University (affiliated with the Probabilistic Machine Learning group and FCAI.\nMy research interests include variational inference, generative models, federated and distributed algorithms, latent-variable models, and Bayesian deep learning.\nIn the past, I have worked as a research data scientist at WearOptimo, a biotechnology startup developing microwearable devices, and completed internships in quantitative trading, consulting and at a national scientific institute. I have also worked as a research assistant and tutored seven courses in mathematics and statistics, from beginner to Master’s level. I am well-versed in using automatic differentiation libraries like JAX and PyTorch, as well as probabilistic programming libraries such as NumPyro, PyMC, Pyro, and Stan.\nContact me at conorhassan.ai@gmail.com and connect with me on LinkedIn, X, and GitHub!"
