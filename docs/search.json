    "text": "LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES: I am looking for postdoctoral roles or positions as a research data scientist or in applied research. My preferred location is Europe and I am available from July 2024. I am interested in working in areas related to privacy-enhancing technologies or in applying statistical and machine learning methods to scientific applications. My interests span tackling methodological problems to development of software to applying existing methods to interesting problems. Contact me at conordaniel.hassan@hdr.qut.edu.au.\nCurrently, I am a PhD student at the QUT Centre for Data Science (in Brisbane, Australia), working with Distinguished Professor Kerrie Mengersen on methods for Bayesian federated learning and differentially private generative models.\nMy research research spans a variety of methods and areas, including variational inference, data-augmentation schemes, score-matching, generative models, differential privacy, federated learning, latent factor models, and Gaussian processes. I am well-versed in using automatic differentiation libraries like JAX and PyTorch, as well as probabilistic programming libraries such as NumPyro, PyMC, Pyro, and Stan.\nIn the past, I have worked as a research data scientist at WearOptimo, a biotechnology startup developing microwearable devices, and completed internships in quantitative trading, consulting and at a national scientific institute. I have also worked as a research assistant and tutored seven courses in mathematics and statistics, from beginner to Master’s level.\nContact me at conordaniel.hassan@hdr.qut.edu.au and connect with me on LinkedIn, X, and GitHub!"
